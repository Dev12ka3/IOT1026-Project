Room Class: The Room class in the Minotaur Labyrinth game represents a specific location or chamber within the game world. It serves as the fundamental component of the labyrinth, shaping the environment that players explore. Each room has its own characteristics, such as its type (entrance, exit, wall, or specialized rooms), which influence gameplay and navigation. The Room class provides methods to access and modify room properties, allowing players to interact with their surroundings. It also offers functionality to determine neighboring rooms and check for specific room types nearby. By utilizing the Room class, the game creates a diverse and immersive maze-like experience, challenging players to navigate through the labyrinth and uncover its secrets.

Guardian Monster: The guardian is a formidable monster encountered within the Minotaur Labyrinth game. As a powerful and ancient entity, the guardian is tasked with protecting a specific section of the labyrinth or a valuable artifact. Each guardian possesses unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses associated with its elemental nature, such as fire, water, or earth. Engaging in a battle with a guardian requires careful planning and strategy, as players must exploit the guardian's vulnerabilities while defending against its formidable attacks. Defeating a guardian rewards players with valuable treasures, progression through the game, and access to new areas of the labyrinth. The presence of guardians adds an element of challenge and excitement to the gameplay, encouraging players to explore and overcome the perils of the Minotaur Labyrinth.
